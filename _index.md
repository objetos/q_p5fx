# p5 functions  

The [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) functions provide seamless tools to **create** and **draw** **quadrille** objects. Whether you're building board games, designing generative visuals, or managing cell-based data, these functions serve as a bridge between the p5.js canvas and the **quadrille object**—the core structure of the **p5.quadrille.js** library.

- **[createQuadrille(args)]({{< ref "create_quadrille" >}}):** Creates a **quadrille** with flexible initialization options. You can populate it with an valid JavaScript value, including [colors](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.Color/), numbers, strings, [images](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.Image/) & [videos](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.MediaElement/), [p5.Graphics](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/p5.Graphics/), (drawing) functions, or custom objects.

- **[drawQuadrille(args)]({{< ref "draw_quadrille" >}}):** Renders the quadrille onto the p5.js canvas with options for visual customization. Styles are applied globally to all quadrille cells, allowing you to display content, apply color, and enhance visuals—well-suited to displaying board game states, dynamic patterns, or data visualizations.    
 
Alongside the [p5.js API](https://p5js.org/reference/), these functions allow you to start developing immersive board games, organizing data collections, creating dynamic visual art, and building creative projects based on structured, cell-based content.
